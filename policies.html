		<h3>Health Standards
 
			
			
			</h3>
		<p>The Director of camp is also our Health Director.  The Health Director is certified in BLS, CPR and First Aid. We will have on-site and off-site parental consent for emergency medical treatment for all campers, as well as a medical log. First aid supplies are available with appropriate items and restocked within 48 hours of use. Cleaning of the studio will be in accordance with the CDC's Guidance. All shared materials will be disinfected between uses. A log will be kept of all sanitizing done each day. The staff member sanitizing is responsible to sign off when completed. A Screening Log for COVID-19 symptoms will be completed and kept on file each day for campers and staff. A completed and signed Release Form is required for all campers, which allows us to know which local Hospital you prefer in case of emergency and allows your child to walk to the playground and have photos taken. 
			 
			</p>
		<p>If a Staff member or Camper displays any of the COVID-19 signs and symptoms COVID-19 they are to stay home. People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
			
			</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Fever or chills</li>
			<li>Cough</li>
			<li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
			<li>Fatigue</li>
			<li>Muscle or body aches</li>
			<li>Headache</li>
			<li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
			<li>Sore throat</li>
			<li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
			<li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
			<li>Diarrhea</li>
		</ul>

		<p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19, proper handwashing etiquette requires all staff and campers to wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds using an antibacterial hand soap. All Staff and Campers must practice respiratory etiquette by wearing face coverings when social distancing can’t be maintained, and reporting illness to the camp Health Director or other healthcare personnel immediately.
		</p>

		<h3>Promoting Healthy Hygiene Practice

			
			</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Reinforce proper hygiene techniques, such as, washing hands and covering coughs and sneezes.</li>
			<li>Reinforce face coverings for staff as well as when it is appropriate for children.</li>
			<li>Make sure to have an adequate supplies of soap, hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and tissues</li>
			<li>Practice frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and will be required to wash their hands upon arriving, before meals or snacks, after going to the bathroom, and prior to leaving for home</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Medical Forms 

			
			</h3>

		<p>All parents/guardians must submit a completed and signed/dated medical form by a physician for each attending child. All medical forms must be dated within one year of the current camp season start date. Any physician indication of asthma or food allergy on your child’s medical form will require a separate care plan from your child’s physician to be submitted to The Renaissance Child for approval before your child can begin camp. You may register for camp without a medical form, but your child may not attend camp until your child’s form is reviewed and approved by The Renaissance Child. You will be notified if further action needs to be taken regarding the medical form. You can find the medical form here: NJ State Pediatric Medical Form </p>

		<h3>Emergency Release 

			</h3>
		
		<p>In the event any child should become injured or ill at The Renaissance Child, our staff will arrange for whatever emergency medical care is deemed necessary and reasonable at the time, including calling local EMS and transportation to a local hospital if needed. (Please state on release form which hospital is preferred)</p>

		<h3>Sicknesses 

			 
			</h3>

		<p>In the event that your child is sick during camp season, please refrain from sending your child to camp. Please make other arrangements as necessary. If your child is showing any symptoms of being sick, they will be isolated from other campers and parents/guardians will be called to immediately pick up the child. No refunds for missed days due to sickness. For the safety of all our campers and teachers, please use the following guidelines:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Fever- The child should remain at home with a fever greater than 100.4°. The child can return to camp after he/she has been fever-free for 24 hours (without fever-reducing medicine such as Tylenol or Motrin).</li>
			<li>Vomiting- If your child has vomited during the night, the child should not be sent to camp. The child can return to camp only after being symptom-free for 24 hours.</li>
			<li>Diarrhea- If your child has had three or more watery stools in a 24-hour period, the child should be kept home. A child with diarrhea should stay at home and return to camp only after being symptom-free for 24 hours.</li>
			<li>Colds- A good rule of thumb is to keep a child home at the beginning of a cold... the most infectious time and when he/she feels the worst. Please keep your child at home if he/she is experiencing discomfort that would interfere with his/her ability to participate in camp (i.e. uncontrollable coughing, severe lack of energy). If your child experiences green nasal discharge that continues throughout the day, or a cough lasting longer than ten days, or is accompanied by fever or chills and is productive of discolored sputum, consult with your physician. Return to camp when the child does not have a persistent cough and feels well.</li>
			<li>Cough or congestion: The child should remain home if the cough or congestion interferes with breathing and/or if wheezing.</li>
			<li>Chicken pox: The child should stay home until there are no new spots and all old ones are scabbed over. Usually this requires a child to stay home seven to ten days.</li>
			<li>Conjunctivitis (pink-eye): Following a diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis, the child may return to camp 24 hours after antibiotic treatment is started. Campers with viral infection may return when eyes are clear.</li>
			<li>Coxsackievirus (Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease): The child must stay home during the acute phase/stage of illness while fever or lesions exist.</li>
			<li>Head lice: The child may return to camp, only after treatment and when hair is free of nits. The child’s head will be checked by staff prior to admittance to camp. </li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Medications 

			
			</h3>
		<p>Only medications prescribed by a doctor and with written authorization and instructions will be allowed to be administered. Any emergency allergy medication (such as an epi-pen) should be brought with your child every day (see MEDICAL FORMS above for requirements). All Medications must be labeled and will be stored properly and in a secure area. Any unused medications will be returned to the parent or destroyed if unable to return. </p>

		<h3>The Renaissance Child's Policies in response to COVID-19</h3>
