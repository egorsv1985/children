			<h2 class="h2 title-border"><span>WHAT WE DO</span></h2>
			<p>Preschoolers begin to <b>develop basic thinking concepts</b>, including notions of quantity, similarity, cause-and-effect, and systematization; children aged 3-5 years learn to understand sign systems (letters, numbers, and the connection between letters and speech). Their interest in learning deepens.</p>
			<p>They learn to interact with each other and to follow and establish rules. Team role-playing and problem-solving become fundamentally important. Similar to toddlers, it is important for preschoolers to learn independently - through movement, sense of touch, and creating something with their own hands.</p>

		<h2 class="h2">WHY STEAM?</h2>

		<ol class="castol-ol castol-ol_center">
			<li>Since the beginning of the 21st century, <b>the world has needed scientists</b> capable of working in the field of innovative technologies.</li>

			<li>It has become clear that <b>traditional subject-based educational programs do not sufficiently cover this need</b> - subjects and disciplines are not perceived holistically and become fragmented information for the child.</li>

			<li>The STEAM approach <b>creates strong logical links between subjects</b>, promotes a global view of the world, and teaches children to notice patterns and correlations.</li>

			<li>Successful professionals of the future must combine and continuously develop the skills of an <b>inventor, scientist, manager, and psychologist</b>, all of which are touched by STEAM's innovative approach.</li>

			<li>STEAM education has a favorable effect on children's <b>self-esteem and values:</b> they see how different spheres of life intertwine, and this gives them a feeling of security, logic, and societal awareness.</li>

				<p>This program includes a diverse curriculum that involves <b>STEAM learning principles</b>. It has both beginner and intermediate level lessons. One of the main goals of this program is to <b>teach kids how to think like scientists</b> as they build LEGO® models. In this class, we challenge kids with strategic questions to guide them through the process of <b>applying science, technology, engineering, art, and math skills</b> and test their ideas to answer different questions.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, the building activities will <b>reinforce the children’s creativity</b> as we use LEGO® models in storytelling and acting.</p>
